        <P>The Bible is God speaking to us, and He says that we must hear His voice and enter into His rest. God told Moses "My presence will go with you and I will give you rest" Moses knew the danger of prospering without the presence of God. But we see in Luke 14 that many were making excuses, and it was the religious people. Whilst there are some who believe it is just the Jews who will not taste of the supper, if they cannot see passed such a presupposition, unable to examine their own heart, they are the ones who will not taste of the supper. Because it was the religious, the seemingly pious and righteous who would not taste of it. Whilst they made excuses in order that they might eat, drink, buy, sell, plant, and build. The very things which were done in the days of Noah and Lot, these people believed to be right with God. It was actually the ones who these people deemed as worthless and outcasts who would taste of that supper, the poor, the lame, the , the prostitutes, the sinners. When referring to the "righteous" He says "do not ask your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbours" Think about what that could mean to you and me today. They deemed those excuses of greater importance than the presence of God, something was more important than the presence of God. Whatever we call them, God calls them excuses. Think about what it means to say I have bought an oxen, I have bought a piece of land, I have married a wife, and what are we saying today? What is hindering Gods presence? What are we placing before it? What are we prioritising over it? Is it serious? God said He was angry. God said they wouldn't taste of the supper. In repentance and rest you will be saved and in quietness and confidence will be your trust.
